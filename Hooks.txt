Hooks are very important in the react.
we can say that hooks is used in new version of react i.e.V16.8.
As we saw that we can use the useState to monitor the state of the components and declaration of these state is in class but
Hooks are not initialize in the class it can use globly to chage or we can say that monitor the states of the components.
#Hooks don't work inside classes.


# List in the React:

we know that the list is very important in any language to declare the array of element.In react we can declare the list using the Map() function as follows:

let arr = [1,2,3];
const ref = arr.map((i)=>{
return i;
})
console.log(ref);

#Output:
[1,2,3]
